# reddcord-py
**Does not use `/commands`!** <br/>
Using praw version 7.5.0
## Usage
**Please don't.** 
This was made for learning purposes. It is neither finished nor does every "feature" work. <br/>
I advise to *just look at it* if you really want to.
### Still want to try?
Put your reddit api token as well as your discord api token inside the `.env` file below inside the same directory. \
`./.env`:
  ```
    # .env
    
    DISCORD_TOKEN = <your-DISCORD_TOKEN>

    CLIENT_SECRET = <your-CLIENT_SECRET>  #reddit
    CLIENT_ID     = <your-CLIENT_ID>      #reddit
    
  ```
Add to your server, start `reddit.py` and `bot.py` &#8594; done
